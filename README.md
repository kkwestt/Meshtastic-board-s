# Meshtastic board's

Hello!
Sometimes, and lately often, I make boards for meshtastic, and in search of the optimal solution for this project, a large number of their variations have accumulated. So I decided to post them. They will all be here. Appearance of the board, diagram and file for assembling the firmware and possibly the firmware itself.
